# Task 6 - Subqueries and Nested Queries

## Objective
Practice subqueries and nested queries in SQL to retrieve complex and filtered data from an **ecommerce** database.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite

## Concepts Practiced
- Scalar subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Subqueries in WHERE clause
- Subqueries in FROM clause

## Steps
1. Connected to the ecommerce database.
2. Identified scenarios for subquery usage (e.g., top spenders, highest-priced products).
3. Wrote scalar subqueries for aggregated values.
4. Implemented correlated subqueries for row-specific data.
5. Used subqueries in `FROM` for derived tables.
6. Verified and validated query results.

## Outcome
- Improved skills in writing advanced SQL queries.
- Learned practical use cases for subqueries in real-world datasets.
